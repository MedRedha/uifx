### Lightweight audio library designed for UI sound effects (UIfx)

```
npm install --save uifx
```

## Usage

```
import UIfx from 'uifx'
import bellAudio from './my-sounds/bell.mp3'

const bell = new UIfx({
  url: bellAudio,
  volume: 0.4,
  throttleMs: 100
})

// playback
bell.play()

// adjust volume
bell.adjustVolume(0.5).play() // number between 0.0 ~ 1.0
// ...or
bell.adjustVolume(0.5)
bell.play()
```


## Technical

It uses the `Audio` API under-the-hood ([Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement)), and will preload audio files so assets are immediately ready for playback. Ideally you'll probably wanna package your mp3 files along with your app.

The library doesn't have any dependencies.


## Why use UIfx?
 
 The main technical distinctive of `UIfx` is that it spawns a new audio player upon playback. This is a small, but important distinction from what SoundManager or Howler provide since short sound effects have different technical requirements than lengthy audio files (e.g., playing a song).
